Ethics & Reproducibility (Task 2):
• Data sources: NASA Exoplanet Archive derivatives (Planetary Systems, Stellar Hosts, Atmospheres).
• Non-personal astronomical data — GDPR not applicable to individuals; complies with UH ethics (no human data).
• Stored securely in OneDrive + versioned code on GitHub; outputs timestamped for reproducibility.
• Bias awareness: detection/confirmation biases in exoplanet catalogues can skew class distributions; macro-F1 used.
• Sustainability: classical ML (RF/GBM) keeps compute modest; report training time where relevant.
• Molecule predictions are exploratory proxies; real inference needs spectroscopic retrieval.
