Why 3B is preferred
---------------------
• 3B uses StratifiedGroupKFold and a group-aware holdout split so the same planet/system never
  appears in both train and test → reduces optimistic leakage.
• 3B excludes direct rule-driving features (radius, mass, equilibrium temp/insolation, eccentricity).
  This forces the model to learn *signals beyond the hand-crafted rule*, improving credibility.
• Scores in 3B are typically lower than 3A but *honest* and more likely to generalise to new planets.
• Confusion matrices and PR/ROC curves for 3B give a more meaningful picture of class trade-offs,
  especially for minority classes.
